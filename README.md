A weather dashboard application that allows the user to search for any city and obtain weather information, such as weather description, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and more. \
Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, OpenWeather API, and Windy MAP API.

## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were executed:

1. Define the purpose, and plan the general idea of the application.
2. Understand the basic functionality of the OpenWeather API.
3. Research and understand how to retrieve a map with the Windy.com API.
4. Search for assets (weather dashboards references, icons, etc.)
5. Define and build the base layout and grid, considering two stages:
   - Mobile-first approach.
   - Responsive design for larger screen sizes.
